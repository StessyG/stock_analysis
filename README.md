	The purpose of this project is to refactor the original code by looping through all the data one time in order to collect the same information.

#Results

	Refactoring this code allowed to perform the analysis in much less macro time.

#Summary: Pros and Cons

	Refactoring this code results in a much cleaner and easily readable code and henceforth a faster code in macro time.

	On the other hand, refactoring may increase the normal time an individual will take to write a code, and could also increase the number of errors/small mistakes for a given code
